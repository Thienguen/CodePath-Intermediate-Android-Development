## Notes

I couldn't make the schedule possible this week to expand my app (due to exams), this was really sad and I work on it the night before it was due, hence the lameness of my app. Definitely I still improve and try to make something out again. This week project was not too bad since we already have a working app from previous week. It is a shame that I couldn't share my creativity like others.
